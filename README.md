# StudyMate

StudyMate is an application that allows you to calculate values using the Ideal Gas Law equation (PV = nRT). It provides a user-friendly interface for calculating the pressure, volume, number of moles, or temperature of an ideal gas.

## Features

- Calculate the missing value in the Ideal Gas Law equation (PV = nRT)
- Input values for pressure, volume, number of moles, and temperature
- Select units for pressure, volume, and temperature
- Clear input fields
- Display the calculated result

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyQt5 library

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Navigate to the cloned repository:

cd StudyMate

Run the application:

python main.py

Enter the known values (three out of pressure, volume, number of moles, and temperature) and select the appropriate units.
